1. Function with parameters remembered, forgotten, and average.
2. Calculate totalRolls as the sum of the length of remembered and forgotten.
3. Calculate rememberedTotal as the sum of all elements in remembered.
4. Calculate averageTotal as the product of average and totalRolls.
5. Calculate missingTotal as the difference between averageTotal and rememberedTotal.
6. 
       
    a. If forgotten is 0:
        i. Check if average is equal to rememberedTotal divided by the length of remembered:
            If not, return [0].
        ii. If yes, return an array of size forgotten filled with average.I'll use this to avoid looping.

    b. If missingTotal is greater than forgotten multiplied by 6 or less than forgotten:
        should return [0] since it's not possible to achieve the average mean.

     c. If totalRolls is less than the length of remembered:
        Return [0] because there are not enough rolls.   
7. Initialize an empty array.
8. Loop over possible dice rolls:
    a. Check if the difference between missingTotal and the current roll is within the valid range [1, 6]:
        i. If yes, add the current roll to the outcome.
9. Check if there are valid rolls in the outcome array:
    a. If yes, return the outcome.
    b. If no, return [0].
